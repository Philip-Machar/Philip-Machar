Hey 👋  
I'm a software engineer focused on building scalable backend systems and cloud-based applications, while also creating clean and performant frontend interfaces.

I enjoy designing reliable services, APIs, and asynchronous systems, and thinking about how software evolves as it grows in complexity and scale.

My core tools:

Backend (Primary): Go, Node.js  
Frontend: React (component architecture, responsive UI, performance)  
Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Docker, CI/CD  
Databases: PostgreSQL

I'm particularly interested in:
- System design and distributed architectures
- Performance and scalability
- Writing maintainable code for long-lived systems

You'll find some of my favorite projects pinned below.
