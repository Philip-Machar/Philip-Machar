# Hey 👋

I'm a software engineer building scalable web applications and cloud-based systems.

I work across the stack — designing backend services, building clean frontend interfaces, and deploying production systems to the cloud.

My core tools are:
- Backend: Go, Node.js
- Frontend: React
- Cloud: AWS
- DevOps: Docker & CI/CD
- Databases: PostgreSQL

I enjoy thinking about system design, performance, and writing code that stays maintainable as it grows.

You'll find some of my favorite projects pinned below.
