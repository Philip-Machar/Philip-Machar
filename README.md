## Hey 👋

I'm a software engineer focused on building scalable backend systems and cloud-based applications, while also creating clean and performant frontend interfaces.

I design reliable services, APIs, and asynchronous systems, and enjoy thinking about how software evolves as it grows in complexity and scale.

## Tech Stack

**Backend (Primary):** Go, Node.js  
**Frontend:** React (component architecture, responsive UI, performance)  
**Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Docker, CI/CD  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB

## Interests

- System design and distributed architectures  
- Performance and scalability  
- Writing maintainable code for long-lived systems
