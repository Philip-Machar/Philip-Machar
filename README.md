Hey 👋  
I'm a software engineer focused on backend systems, distributed architectures, and cloud-based applications.

I design and build scalable services, APIs, and async processing systems, while also working with frontend interfaces when needed.

My core tools:

Backend: Go, Node.js  
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS  
Cloud: AWS  
DevOps: Docker, CI/CD  
Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB

I’m especially interested in system design, performance, and building infrastructure that remains reliable as systems scale.

Some of my favorite projects are pinned below.
